# Income-Prediction-Challenge-For-Azubian
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict if an individual earns above or below a certain amount. This can help monitor income levels between censuses, aiding policymakers in managing and reducing income inequality, especially in developing nations facing rising AI and automation challenges.
